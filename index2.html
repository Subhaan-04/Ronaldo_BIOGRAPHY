    <h2>Club Play</h2>
    <pre><big><b>After a successful season with Sporting that brought the young player to the attention of Europe’s biggest football clubs, Ronaldo
signed with English powerhouse <a href="https://www.manutd.com/">Manchester United</a> in 2003. He was an instant sensation and soon came to be regarded as one of the best
forwards in the game. His finest season with United came in 2007–08, when he scored 42 League and Cup goals and earned the Golden Shoe 
award as Europe’s leading scorer, with 31 League goals. After helping United to a Champions League title in May 2008, Ronaldo captured

United to an appearance in the 2009 Champions League final, which they lost to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tDP1TfIKEsvMWD04klLVkhKLEpOzcnPSwQAXAQH3g&client=opera-gx&q=fc+barcelona&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8#cobssid=s">FC Barcelona</a>.</big></b></pre></section>

 million (about $131 million) transfer fee. His scoring prowess continued with his new team, and he netted the most goals (40) in La Liga 
history during the 2010–11 season (his record was broken the following season by his rival <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lionel+messi&client=opera-gx&hs=TLT&sca_esv=f725a80e7498c0c2&sxsrf=ADLYWIJ3HoPkAmHwtw-yCLrwhxqb4aB-YA%3A1728052616503&ei=iP3_ZoCsHp32seMPzpPcwA0&gs_ssp=eJzj4tTP1TcwK8xKTzZg9OLJyczPS81RyE0tLs4EAGLjCDU&oq=l&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiAWwqAggGMgoQIxiABBgnGIoFMgoQIxiABBgnGIoFMgQQIxgnMhAQLhiABBixAxhDGIMBGIoFMhAQLhiABBixAxhDGIMBGIoFMgoQABiABBhDGIoFMgoQLhiABBhDGIoFMgoQLhiABBhDGIoFMgsQABiABBixAxiKBTIIEAAYgAQYsQMyGRAuGIAEGEMYigUYlwUY3AQY3gQY3wTYAQFI0BZQAFgAcAB4AZABAJgB-QGgAfkBqgEDMi0xuAEByAEA-AEBmAICoAK8GJgDALoGBggBEAEYFJIHBzItMS44LTGgB-gZ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp">Lionel Messi</a> of Barcelona). In 2011–12 Ronaldo
helped Madrid capture a La Liga championship and scored a personal-best 46 goals during the League season. He scored a total of 66 goals
in 56 appearances with Madrid and the Portuguese national team in 2013 to earn his second world player of the year award
(the FIFA World Player of the Year was renamed the FIFA Ballon d’Or in 2010).</big></b></pre>

   <pre> <big><b>In 2014 he scored 52 goals in 43 games and led Madrid to a Champions League title, which resulted in Ronaldo  capturing another 
Ballon d’Or award.In 2014–15 he netted 48 goals to lead La Liga in scoring. Ronaldo netted his 324th goal as a member of Real in October
2015 to become the club’s all-time leading goal scorer. He scored 35 La Liga goals in 2015–16 and helped Real win its record 11th
Champions League title, and in December 2016 he won a fourth career Ballon d’Or for his accomplishments. Ronaldo scored 42 goals for
Real across all competitions in 2016–17 and led his team to La Liga and Champions League titles that season, which resulted in a fifth
career Ballon d’Or award. In 2017–18 he scored 44 goals in 44 games,and Real won a third straight Champions League title.In July 2018 he 
reached a four-year contract worth €112 million (about $132 million) with the Italian powerhouse Juventus. He finished his Real career with 
311 goals in 292 matches. He scored 28 goals in his first season with Juventus—his lowest domestic goal total since his last season with
Manchester United—as the powerhouse club won its eighth straight Italian league title. In the 2019–20 season Ronaldo helped the club
capture another league title, and Juventus later won the 2020 Supercoppa Italiana and the 2021 Coppa Italia Final. Several months after
the latter match, he left Juventus and returned to Manchester United. His second stint with the club proved disappointing, however. Both
 Ronaldo and Manchester struggled,and he expressed growing dissatisfaction with the club. In November 2022 his contract was terminated
by “mutual agreement.” The following month Ronaldo signed with the Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr.</b></big></pre>
